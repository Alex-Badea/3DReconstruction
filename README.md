# 3DReconstruction
A MATLAB implementation of a full 3D Reconstruction pipeline using the functions provided by the Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Electrical Engineering
- At the moment, it can do Dense Multiple Reconstruction from only up to 6 images due to inappropriate initialization of the Bundle Adjustment algorithm; Will be fixed with the upcoming implementation of the P3P algorithm.
